      <h2> Introduction </h2>
      <p> 
          Welcome to my 2020 STEP Intern portfolio! Other than being a Google STEP Intern, I 
          am a sophomore Electrical Engineering major at Caltech. At Caltech, I play varsity water
          polo and eat brunch with my friends on the weekends. Now I'm at home in Sugar Land, Texas 
          reading and listening to podcasts. 
     </p>
     <p>
          Here's a list of fun facts (because everyone is always asking for them in introductions):
          <ul> 
              <li> I play varsity women's water polo at Caltech. </li>
              <li> Brunch is my favorite meal because it's two meals in one (
                  also the word itself flows better than breakfast and lunch). </li>
              <li> I've watch and finish way too many TV shows--Grey's Anatomy, 
                  Gossip Girl, Money Heist, Hart of Dixie, White Collar--just to name a few.</li>
              <li> I also really like reading books and listening to podcasts </li>
              <li> I love traveling! Last summer I backpacked through Spain and Portugal for a month. </li>
          </ul>
